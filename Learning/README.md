    <h2>What is Flutter?</h2>
    <p>Flutter is a combination of two main parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UI Framework: This means that Flutter is a collection of code packages and things which we can use in the code to write cross-platform apps. With Flutter, we can have a single code base and yet generate apps for a broad variety of target platforms. This is a huge advantage because otherwise we will have to learn several different programming languages for different platforms because historically, there wasn't any shared programming language which could have been used to target all the platforms.</li>
        <li>Collection of Tools: These are used in combination with our code to actually convert our code to the code which can run on all the different target platforms.</li>
    </ul>
